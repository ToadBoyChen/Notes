    "## Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence of real numbers is any infinite list of real numbers. This maybe $1,2,3,4,\\dots$, or $1, 4, 9,16,\\dots$ or even $1,1,1,1,\\dots$. One should note that though the sequences we are concerned with have a rule, they not need one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote a sequence by $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ to denote the sequence $x-1, x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_n$, \\dots. We can therefore write expressions like $(n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ or $(1)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ and finally $(x^2)_{n = 1}^\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence is a __function__ which $S: \\N \\rightarrow \\R$ by $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty} : n \\mapsto x_n$. We iterate $n$ by $1$ and usually start on $n = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence to Zeros\n",
    "#### Definition of a Convergence to Zero\n",
    "A sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ converges to $0$, given by $x_n \\rightarrow 0 : n \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x_n = 0$ if $\\forall \\epsilon > 0 \\exists N \\in \\N : \\forall n \\in \\N, n > N : |x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should _remark_ that $\\epsilon \\in \\R$ is always the case, and $N, n \\in \\N$ is also always the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We say that the sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ converges to $\\ell \\in \\R$ if the sequence defined by $y_n = x_n - \\ell$ converges to $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that statements about convergence to other limits that zero can be converted into statements about convergence to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us understand this definition let's play a __demon game__:\n",
    "1. Demon picks $\\epsilon > 0$,\n",
    "1. We pick $N \\in \\N$,\n",
    "1. Demon picks $n > N$,\n",
    "1. We win if $|x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dominated Convergence\n",
    "If $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a sequence which converges to zero and $(y_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a sequence with $|y_n| \\le |x_n| \\forall n \\in \\N$, then $(y_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ must also converge to zero. Additionally, if $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ does not converge to zero and $|y_n| \\ge |x_n| \\forall n \\in \\N$ then we can state that $(y_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ does not converge to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ converges to zero and $c \\in \\R$, then $(cx_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ converges to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summing Sequences that Converge to Zero \n",
    "If $(x_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ and $(y_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ converge to zero, then $z_n = x_n + y_n$ from $(z_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ also converges to zero, for all $n \\in \\N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Triangle Inequality\n",
    "$\\forall x, y \\in \\R : |x + y| \\le |x| + |y|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bernoulli's Inequality\n",
    "if $\\alpha \\in \\R, \\alpha \\ge -1 \\implies \\forall n\\in\\N : (1 + \\alpha)^n \\ge 1 + n\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Sequences\n",
    "If $c \\in \\R$ and $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ by $x_n = c^n$, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $(x_n)$ converges to zero if $|c| < 1$,\n",
    "1. $(x_n)$ does not converge to zero if $|c| \\ge 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Product of sequences Converging to Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "If $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ and $(y_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ both converge to zero, $(x_ny_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty$ also converges to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I_1, I_2, I_3, \\dots$ be a decreasing sequence of nested closed intervals, i.e., $I_n = [a_n, b_n], ~ \\forall n \\in \\N$, $I_{n + 1} \\subseteq I_n$ and finally $\\forall \\epsilon > 0 exists n \\in N : b_n - a_n < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to show, by the completeness axiom that $$\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n = \\{x\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For some unique $x \\in \\R$. The idea is $a_1 \\le a_2 \\le a_3 \\le \\dots \\le b_3 \\le b_2 \\le b_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\}$, where $A \\neq \\empty$, and $A$ is bounded above by $b_1$ ($A_n \\in A$ where $a_n \\le b_n \\le b_1$). The claim is that $x \\in I_n \\forall n \\in \\N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fix $n \\in \\N$. Since $x $ is a upper bound for $A$, $x \\ge a_n$. It also holds that $x \\le b_n$. By contradiction $x > b_n$, then $b_n $ is an upper bound for $A$ which is smaller than $x$. This contradicts $x = \\text{sup}(A)$. We've now shown that $\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n = \\{x\\}$. Suppose for contradiction that $\\exists \\{y\\} \\in \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} I_n = \\{x\\} \\neq \\{y\\}$ Define $\\epsilon = |x - y| > 0 \\forall n \\in \\N, x \\in I_n, y \\in I_n \\implies b_n - a_n \\ge \\epsilon$. \n"
