    "## Home Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look up proof of $\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $z \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, is the following true? $z\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$? Its clear that it depends on $z$, that being if $z = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: Suppose $z\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{m}{n} \\implies \\frac{p\\sqrt{2}}{q} = \\frac{m}{n} \\implies \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{mq}{np}$. We have [obviously] assumed that $z \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corollary - Irrationals are Dense in $\\R$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $x, y \\in \\R, x > y, \\exists z \\in \\R / \\mathbb{Q} : x < z < y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: Apply __theorem 217__: $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}} < z < \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Its assumed that $z \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We get $x < z\\sqrt{2} < y$. We therefore know that $z\\sqrt{2} \\in \\R/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Completeness Axiom for Infima\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $a \\subseteq \\R, a \\neq \\empty : \\exists ~ \\text{infima} \\in \\R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof Idea_: $B = \\{-x : x \\in A\\}$. $A$ being non empty and bounded below means that $B$ is non empty and bounded above. Additionally, by the completeness axiom the $\\text{sup}(B) = x \\implies -x = \\text{inf}(A)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence is just some list of numbers, for example $1,2,3,4,5,\\dots$. __Thought: is there some rule to construct any given random list of numbers?__ For example can we find a rule to calculate $\\pi, e, \\sqrt{44}, 1, 99^3, \\dots$?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of a sequence as a function $f: \\N \\rightarrow \\R$ by $n \\mapsto x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $(x_n)$ converges to zero, we may write $(x_n)\\rightarrow 0$ or $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (x_n) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences Converging to Zero  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ converges to zero $\\iff \\forall \\epsilon > 0 \\exists N \\in \\N \\forall n \\in \\N, n > N : |x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this definition lets play the __demon game__.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Demon picks $\\epsilon > 0$.\n",
    "1. We pick $N \\in \\N$. (This step is really important as there is an exists symbol!)\n",
    "1. Demon picks $n > N$. \n",
    "1. Check if $|x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "    * We win if $|x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "    * We lose if $|x_n| \\ge \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play a Game involving $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty} = (\\frac{1}{n})_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Demon picks $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{4}$\n",
    "1. We pick $N = 10$.\n",
    "1. Demon picks $n > 10$, say $n = 11$.\n",
    "1. $|x_n| = \\frac{1}{11} < \\frac{1}{4} = \\epsilon$. We win. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another game,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Demon picks $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{1000}$\n",
    "1. We pick $N = 1000$.\n",
    "1. Demon picks $n > 1000$, say $n = 1001$.\n",
    "1. $|x_n| = \\frac{1}{1001} < \\frac{1}{1000} = \\epsilon$. We win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demon is basically saying that \"I want $x_n$ to be within $\\epsilon$ of $0$\". \"I want you to find how many $N$ along you must be to always be within $\\epsilon$ of $0$.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now suppose the demon picks some $\\epsilon$, i.e., $\\frac{1}{n} < epsilon$. $\\exists N$ due to the Arch property. It makes sense to choose $N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ because $\\epsilon \\rightarrow \\infty$, and so $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ as well, i.e., we need more steps to work within the smaller bounds chosen by $\\epsilon$. If $n > N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\implies \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: Claim - $\\frac{1}{n}$ converges to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given $\\epsilon > 0$ take $N \\in \\N : N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. $\\exists N$ because Archimedian property. Then given $n > N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\implies n > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ which is helpful because $\\frac{1}{n} < \\epsilon \\implies |x_n| = |\\frac{1}{n}| = \\frac{1}{n} < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "$(x_n) = (\\frac{1}{n^2})$. We want $|x_n| < \\epsilon \\iff \\frac{1}{n^2} < \\epsilon \\iff n^2 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\iff n > \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$."
