    "The __definition__ of a geometric sequence is, given $c \\in \\R : (x_n) = c^n \\forall n \\in \\N$. If $|c|<1 \\iff (x_n) \\longrightarrow 0$, else $|c|\\ge 1 \\iff (x_n) \\not\\longrightarrow 0$.\n",

    "Suppose $x_n \\longrightarrow 0, y_n \\longrightarrow 0$, then $x_ny_n \\longrightarrow 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof of Theorem 3.15_: Given $\\epsilon > 0$, we want $|x_ny_n| < \\epsilon$. This is distributive, i.e., $|x_n||y_n| < \\epsilon$ (not to be confused with the triangle inequality). Given $|x_n||y_n| < \\epsilon, \\exists \\epsilon' = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define $\\epsilon' = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}, \\epsilon >0$. Since $x_n \\longrightarrow 0 \\exists N_x \\in \\N : \\forall n \\in \\N_x : |x_n| < \\epsilon'$. Since $y_n \\longrightarrow 0 \\exists N_y \\in \\N : \\forall n \\in \\N_y : |y_n| < \\epsilon'$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define $N = \\max\\{N_x, N_y\\}$. Then, for $n > N: |x_ny_n| = |x_n||y_n| < \\epsilon'\\epsilon' = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon$. \n",

    "#### Definition 3.18 - Bounded Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence $(c_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ is bounded above if $\\exists M \\in \\R : x_n \\leq M \\forall n \\in \\N$. A sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$ is bounded below if $\\exists m \\in \\R : x_n \\geq m \\forall n \\in \\N$. Therefore a sequence $(x_n)_{n = 1}^{\\infty}$, is bounded if and only if it is both bounded above and bounded below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sequence $x_n = \\frac{1}{n}$ is bounded, i.e., it is bounded above and below. \n",
    "1. The sequence $x_n = n$ is __not__ bounded above, but is bounded below, i.e., $\\not\\exists M : M \\ge x_n \\forall n \\in N$.\n",

    "#### Theorem 3.21\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_n \\longrightarrow 0$, and $y_n$ is bounded, then $x_ny_n \\longrightarrow 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem generalises Theorem 3.15, as it applies to sequences that are both bounded and convergent.\n",
