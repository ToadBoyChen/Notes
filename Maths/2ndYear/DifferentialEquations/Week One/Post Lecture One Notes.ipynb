    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An __ODE__ is a ordinary differential equation of an n-th order, and is a relation between a unknown function $y = y(x)$ of a __single independent variable__, say $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and the derivatives,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y' \\equiv \\frac{dy}{dx}, \\dots, y^{(n)} \\equiv \\frac{d^n y}{dx^n}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolically, we can write any ODE in the form,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x, y, y', y'', \\dots, y^{(n)}) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a ODE is an equation involving a function of a single real variable, and its derivatives. Note that the order of a ODE is the highest number of the differential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function $y = f(x)$ is defined in some interval $x \\in (A, B)$, which when substituted into $F(x, y, y', \\dots, y^{(n)}) = 0$ reduces the equation to a __identity__, and is called a __solution__ of the equation. Additionally, $(A, B)$ is known as the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations have a direct relation to physics, computer science, chemistry etcetera. That is why these are extremely important to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a practical sense, our singular variable $x$ is usually $t$ which is time. in this case, we use sightly different notation, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}, \\ddot{y} = \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2}, \\dots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example through Newton\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's second law is $f = ma$, where we can say that the point mass, $m$, is moving along the $y$ axis. By definition, $\\dot{y} = v$ and $\\ddot{y} = a$, which is $\\dot{v} = a$. This means that we can express Newton's second law as a __second order differential equation__, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\ddot{y} = f(t, y, \\dot{y}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where force, that's $f$, maybe time and velocity dependent as a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of First Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Solutions to First First Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "A first order ODE of __normal form__ is in general $y' = f(x, y)$. This allows us to develop a completely analytical solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __simplest case__ is where we have, $$y' = f(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to such an example is simply $y = \\int f(x) ~ dx + c, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separable First Order ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "A separable ODE is one which is where our derivative is equal the product of a function of the independent variable and its following functions. I.e., for a first order separable ODE, the general form is, $$y' = f(x)g(y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ are continuos on their respective domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set $g(y) = 0$ and get a set of solutions, say $y_1, y_2, y_3, \\dots, y_k$, then we may state that $y(x) \\in \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, \\dots, y_k\\}$. This is simply saying that $g(y) = 0 \\implies g(y(x)) = 0 $ for $y(x) \\in \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, \\dots, y_k\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may also take a different approach for a general solution, though it is not mathematically well defined and so we will soon ignore this method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Treating $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a ratio of the difference of $x$ and $y$, we may,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y) \\longrightarrow \\frac{dy}{g(y)} = f(x)~ dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can integrate both sides to achieve the relation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int\\frac{1}{g(y)} ~ dy =\\int f(x)~ dx + c, \\text{ for } c \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we then create $H: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R} : H(y) \\equiv \\int \\frac{1}{g(y)} ~ dy$, we can state $H(y) = \\int f(x) ~dx + c$. Because we have a function $H$, $H^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, and its in this case there exists at least one inverse. __This is not a rigours justification__, though we will proceed with the following implication,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = \\int f(x) ~ dx + c\\\\ \\\\ H(y) = u \\iff y = H^{-1}(u).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this, we may develop a general solution which is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = H^{-1}\\left(\\int f(x) ~ dx + c\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One should note that there may exist multiple inverse functions of $H$, take the simple example of $H(y) = y^2, y^2 = u \\implies y = \\pm \\sqrt{u}$ for $u > 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Example One:_ Find a non constant solution to $y' = xy^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the equation $y' = xy^2 \\equiv \\frac{dy}{dx} = x y^2$, which can be put in form $\\frac{dy}{y^2} = x~dx$. We need to integrate the expression,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int \\frac{1}{y^2} ~ dy = \\int x ~ dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding $H(y) = \\int \\frac{1}{y^2} ~ dy$, we get $H(y) = (-2 + 1)^{-1}(y)^{-2 + 1} + c = -\\frac{1}{y} + c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us, $$-\\frac{1}{y} = (1 + 1)^{-1}(x)^{1 + 1} + c = -\\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x^2}{2} + c.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $H(y) = -\\frac{1}{y}$, set $u = -\\frac{1}{y} : y = -\\frac{1}{u} = H^{-1}(y).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the general solution is $y = H^{-1}\\left(\\int f(x) ~ dx + c\\right)$, we see that,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{x^2}{2} + c} = -\\frac{2}{x^2} + c.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is such case when one cannot find a constant or general solution, we should simply state that the equation has a solution in an implicit form, given by the function of $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Order ODEs which are Reducible and Separable\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us this time consider the equation of the form $y' = f(ax + by + c)$. "
