    "A linear equations in $n$ unknowns, $ x_1, \\dots, x_n$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ is an expression of the form, $$\\alpha_1 x_1, \\alpha_2 x_2, \\dots, \\alpha_n x_n = \\beta, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_n \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, a system of eqautions of $m$ linear equations in $n$ unknowns is the collection of equations of the form,\n",

    "&\\text{where } \\alpha_{ij}, \\beta_j \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution of the above system is a vector $c = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma_1 \\\\ \\gamma_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\gamma_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting $x_j = \\gamma_j$ for $j = 1, \\dots, n$ all equations become satisfied, i.e., \n",

    "1. Each leading one is to the right og the leading $1$.\n",

    "An even better way to solve a matrix is __reduced row echelon form__, or __RREF__. This is satisfied if additionally, if each leading one is the only non zero entry in a row.\n",

    "A __leading variable__ is one which is obviously leading within a matrix, and __free ones__ are not. We can develop small and simple expressions for free variables. \n",
