    "# Week Two Catchup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems of Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Two groups of systems are said to be __equivalent__ if they have the same solution set, which often takes form $\\{a, b, c, d, \\dots\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the basis for row operations is from the idea that,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can interchange two equations,\n",
    "1. We can multiply equations by a non zero scalar,\n",
    "1. We can add multiples of other equations to a different equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Row echelon form__ is where we have a upper triangular matrix, and __reduced row echelon form__ is where the leading non zero term is $1$ or $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have an $m \\times n$ matrix, it is said to be __overdetermined__ if it has more equations than unknowns, i.e., $m > n$, but __underdetermined__ if it has less equations than unknowns, i.e., $m < n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system is said to be __homogenous__ if its equal to zero, and __inhomogeneous__ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "We write $A = (a_{ij})_{m \\times n}$ to denote a $m \\times n$ matrix whose $ij$-th entry is $a_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zero matrix is a matrix of only zeros, and is denoted by $O_{m\\times n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two matrices, $A = (a_{ij})_{m \\times n}$ and $B = (b_{ij})_{n \\times p}$, the produce $AB$ is $C = (c_{ij})_{m \\times p}$ by $$c_{ij} = \\sum_{k = 1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity matrix is a matrix who only contains zeros on the top left to bottom right diagonal. Denoted by $I_{m \\times n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two matrices $A$ and $B$ and said to __commute__ if $AB = BA$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $AB = I$ and $BA = I$, then $B$ is the inverse of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of all $n$-vectors is denoted by $\\R^n$, and takes form,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\R^n = \\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\\\a_2\\\\a_3\\\\\\vdots\\\\a_n\\end{pmatrix} \\middle| a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_n \\in \\R\\right\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determinants\n",
    " \n",
    "$$A = (a_{ij})_{n \\times n} : \\det(A) = \\sum_{ i = 1}^{n} (-i)^{i + j}a_{ij}\\det(A_{ij}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "note, we choose $j$ to be the easiest column to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "C_{11} & C_{21} & \\dots & C_{n1}\\\\ \n",
    "C_{12} & C_{22} & \\dots & C_{n2} \\\\ \n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    " C_{1n} & C_{2n} & \\dots & C_nn\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $C_{ji} = (-1)^{i + j}\\det(A_{ji})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __adjugate__ is the matrix of cofactor terms, so we may rewrite this formula as, $$A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\text{adj}(A).$$\n",

    "## Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of a Vector Space\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Vector Space__ is a non empty set $V$ where there are two operations called _addition_ and _scalar multiplication_, such that the following axioms hold for $u, v, w \\in V$, and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\R$,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $u + v \\in V$,\n",
    "1. $\\alpha u \\in V$,\n",
    "1. $u + v = v + u$,\n",
    "1. $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$,\n",
    "1. $u + 0 = 0 + u = u$,\n",
    "1. $u + (-u) = u + (-1)(u) = 0$,\n",
    "1. $\\alpha(u + v) = \\alpha u + \\alpha v$,\n",
    "1. $(\\alpha + \\beta)u = \\alpha u + \\beta v$,\n",
    "1. $(\\alpha \\beta)u = \\alpha(\\beta u)$,\n",
    "1. $1u = 1(u) = u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V$ refers to the universal set fo the vector space, where its elements are vectors. We work with __real vector spaces__ and __complex vectors spaces__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub Spaces\n",
    "A subspace of a vector space is in some sense a subset of a $V$, i.e., $H \\subseteq V$, making $H$ almost a subspace. A subspace itself is obviously a subspace, and this can allow us to prove vector spaces exist by proving vector subspaces, which is __much easier__. The only axioms a subspace must obey are the __closure axioms__, this being two axioms easily proven. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of a Vector Subspace\n",
    "Let $H \\neq \\empty : H \\subseteq V$. $H$ is a subspace $\\iff u, v \\in H : u + v \\in H$ and $u \\in H, \\alpha in \\R : \\alpha u \\in H$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It follows by logic that $H$ if inheriting addition and scalar multiplication from $V$ that $H$ it itself a vector subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important cases of subspaces is that given $V$, $\\{V\\}$ and $\\{0\\}$ are themselves trivial __but valid subspaces of__ $V$. The Zero subspace is obviously $\\{0\\}$, and all __proper subspaces__ are subspaces which are not $\\{0\\}$ nor $\\{V\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Non Example_: $H = \\{(r^2, s, r)^T : r, s \\in \\R\\}$. This must satisfy the closure laws to be considered a subspace and therefore in its own respect a vector space but,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} \\in H : 2\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} \\notin H.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A \\in \\R^{m \\times n} : N(A) = \\{X \\in \\R^n : Ax = 0\\}$. This is known as the __null space__ of $A$. It should be noted that $A \\in \\R^{m \\times n}$ then $N(A)$ is a subspace of $\\R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null space can be though of as the set of all solutions to a homogeneous system. An example may look as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} \n",
    "-3 & 6 & -1 & 1 & -7 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -2 & 2 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "2 & -4 & 5 & 8 & -4\\end{pmatrix},\\\\ \\\\ \\implies N(A) = \\left\\{\\alpha\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} + \\beta\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\-2\\\\1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} + \\gamma\\begin{pmatrix}-3\\\\0\\\\2\\\\0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} \\middle| \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\R\\right\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Span of a Set of Vectors\n",
    "We will look into how we can construct subspaces from a collection of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of the Span of a Set of Vectors\n",
    "Let $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ be vectors in a vector space $V$. The set of all linear combinations of $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ is called the __span__ of $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$. We denote this span as $\\text{span}\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$. More formally, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Span}(v_1, \\dots, v_n) = \\{\\alpha_1 v_1 + \\dots + \\alpha_n v_n : \\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n \\in \\R\\}.$$"
