    "\n",
    "To actually find $r, s$ we must calculate the gcd and work in reverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Example One - Continued:_ $\\gcd(6, 5) = 1 \\implies 6 = 1(5) + 1 \\implies 1(6) + -1(5) = 1$.\n",

    "20&=1(12) + 8\\\\\n",
    "12&= 1(8) + 4\\\\\n",
    "8 &= 2(4) + 0\n",

    "### Following Lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, d \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then the following two statements are equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The equation $ax + by = d$ has solutions in $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "1. $\\gcd(a,b) \\mid d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax + by = d \\text{ for }x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z} \\iff \\gcd(a, b) \\mid d.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "_Rationale One:_ can we find integer solutions in the equation $2x + 4y = 3$? Note that the number of the solutions is not infinite as we are bound by integers. Given that both $2$ nor $4$ divides $3$, we have __no__ solutions. I.e., $\\gcd(2,4) = 2 \\nmid 3 \\not{\\implies} 2x + 4y = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Rationale Two:_ can we find integer solutions in the equation $5x + 15y = 25$? __Yes__, because of our lemma $ax + by = d \\text{ for }x,y\\in\\mathbb{Z} \\iff \\gcd(a, b) \\mid d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Prove that,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ax + by = d \\implies \\gcd(a, b) \\mid d$,\n",
    "1. $\\gcd(a, b) \\mid d \\implies ax+by = d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $g = \\gcd(a, b) : g \\mid a $ and $ g \\mid b \\implies g \\mid ax + by = d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Bezout's identity, $\\exists~ r,s\\in\\mathbb{Z} : ar + bs = \\gcd(a, b) = g$. As $g \\mid d \\implies ~\\exists~ q\\in\\mathbb{Z} : d = qg$. If $x = rq$ and $y = sq$ then $ax + by = arq + bsq = q(ar+bs) \\implies gq = d$.\n",

    "## Primes and factorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Prime\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Def One\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is prime if b can be divided by __only__ $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Def Two\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}: b$ is prime. The following are equivalent,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $b \\mid ab$,\n",
    "1. $b \\mid a ~\\lor~ b \\mid b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Every $ n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ can be written as a produce of prime numbers. Moreover, the way of writing the product is unique, up to reordering. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Example One:_ $n = 15 = 3 \\times 5 = 5 \\times 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example Two:_ $n = 12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 - \\dots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reordering refers to the fact that we do __not__ care about order, but the actual numbers are unique. "
