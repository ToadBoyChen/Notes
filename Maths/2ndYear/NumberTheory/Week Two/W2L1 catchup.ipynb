    "\n",
    "Let $n \\in \\N$. We say that $a, b \\in \\Z$ are congruent modulo $n$ if $n\\mid(a - b)$ or $a-b = k(n), k \\in \\N$, and we write $a \\equiv b \\mod n$, or $a \\equiv_n b$ or $a \\equiv b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The congruence operation is in fact an equivalence relation; there are $n$ equivalence classes corresponding to $0, 1, \\dots, n - 1$, and are called congruence classes modulo $n$. We denote the classes by $[a]_n$, that is to say that $[a]_n = \\{z \\in \\Z : z \\equiv a \\mod n\\} = \\{\\dots, a - 2n, a - n, a, a + n, a + 2n, \\dots\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, any member of the congruence class $[a_n]$ can also represent the class, i.e., $a \\equiv b \\mod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful properties are that $[a]_n + [b]_n = [a + b]_n$, and that $[a]_n \\times [b]_n = [a \\times b]_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should note that representatives shouldn't matter when dealing with these basic operations. $a \\equiv a' \\mod n' \\implies [a] + [b] = [a'] + [b']$? i.e., does it matter if we have say the equation $[2]_5 + [3]_5 = [7]_5 +  [8]_5$? No it doesn't.\n",
