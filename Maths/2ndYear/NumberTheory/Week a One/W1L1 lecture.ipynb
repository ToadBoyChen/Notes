    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fermat's Last Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Find solutions in $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $x^3 + y^3 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some solutions may include $1^3 + 0^3 = 1$. Its actually a known fact that the solutions $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ are the only ones to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should look into _Langland's program_, which is in relation to Fermat's last theorem. This also relates another topic known as _Arithmetic geometry_. Fermat's last theorem (proven) shows that,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Only one trivial solution: }\\begin{cases}\n",
    "x^3 + y^3 &= 1\\\\\n",
    "x^4 + y^4 &= 1\\\\\n",
    "x^5 + y^5 &= 1\\\\\n",
    "&\\vdots\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goldbach's Conjecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Goldbach observed that every even number is a sum of two prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example_: $$4 = 2 + 2\\\\ 6 = 3 + 3\\\\ 8 = 5 + 3\\\\ \\vdots$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This is still an open problem__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diophantine Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, there are irrational numbers, where we cannot write a number as a ratio, i.e., $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$ has no such $a$ or $b$ to fully equal $\\sqrt{2}$. Though we may __approximate__ $\\sqrt{2}$, which is known as a Diophantine approximation. An approximation for root $2$ is $$\\sqrt{2} \\approx \\frac{141}{100} \\text{ or } \\frac{1414}{1000} \\dots$$\n",

    "## Chapter One\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer set is $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\dots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. Z is used because of Zahlem, the german work for number. \n",
    "\n",
    "The natural set is $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural set __with zero__ is $\\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0,1,2,3,\\dots\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "For $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, we say that $a \\mid b \\iff qa = b, q\\in\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We may state things like $2 \\mid 6$ as $3(2) = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclid's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\\in\\mathbb{N}$ $\\exists~ r,q\\in \\mathbb{Z}: 0 \\leq r < b$ and $a = qb + r$. $r, q$ are __unique__.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Take two numbers $(7, 3)$ such that we get $7 = 2(3) + 1$. This implies that the $\\gcd(7, 3) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Take two numbers $(15, 9)$ such that we get $15 = 1(9) + 6$. This is further iterated by $9 = 1(6) + 3$ and then $6 = 2(3) + 0$. This implies that the $\\gcd(15, 9) = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greatest Common Divisor\n",
    "\n",
    "For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we define $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ if $d$ is a common divisor and $d$ is the largest among all the common divisors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We say that $a, b$ are coprime to each other if $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a = qb + r, 0 \\leq r < b$. The $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(b, a)$."
