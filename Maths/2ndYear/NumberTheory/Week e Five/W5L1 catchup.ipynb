    "\n",
    "### Euler's Totient Function\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition__ Euler's Totient Function, or the $\\phi$ function is $\\phi : \\N \\longrightarrow \\N$ by $n \\in \\N \\mapsto |1 \\le z \\le n| : \\gcd(z, n) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________________________\n",
    "__Example__ If $p$ is prime then $\\phi(p) = p - 1$, as $1, 2, 3, \\dots, p-1$ are all co-prime to $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example__ If $n = 8$, we have $\\phi(8) = 4$ as $1, 3, 5, 7$ are all co-prime to $8$.\n",
    "________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition__ If $R$ is a commutative ring with an identity, then $r \\in R$ is said to be a unit if $\\exists s \\in R : rs = 1$. The units in $R$ form a group under multiplication, denoted by $R^\\times$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 14\n",
    "\n",
    "The number $|(\\Z / n\\Z^\\times)|$ of elements from the group $(\\Z / n\\Z^\\times)$ of units in $\\Z / n\\Z$ is $\\phi(n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: Let $[z]$ be a unit in $\\Z / n\\Z \\iff \\gcd(z, n) = 1$. It then follows that $\\exists r, s \\in \\Z : zr + ns = 1$, by Bezout's identity. It also follows that $zr \\equiv 1 \\mod N \\iff [z][r] = [1]$, for $[z]$ being the unit. Conversely suppose that $[z]$ is a unit (as we are proving a implicit iff statement, which is stronger than a normal implication). $\\exists [r] \\in \\Z : [z][r] = [zr] = [1]$. It therefore follows that $zr \\equiv 1 \\mod n \\implies zr + ns = 1, r \\in \\Z$. If we let $d = \\gcd(z, n)$, by definition $d$ divides $z$ and $n$, and therefore $zr + ns$. Therefore $d = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be a positive integer and $z$ be an integer such that $\\gcd(z, n) = 1$. Then $z^{\\phi(n)}\\equiv 1 \\mod n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Proof_: (1) Let $N = \\phi(n)$ and let $z_1, \\dots, z_N$ be the integers in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ that are relatively prime to $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1) We define $N$ as $\\phi(n)$ to simply shorten the proof. We then define some general integers $z_1, \\dots, z_N$ as to be the same integers in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $\\gcd(z_i, n) = 1$, for $i = 1, \\dots, N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Consider the set $\\{r_1, \\dots r_N\\}$ where $r_j$ is defined to be the residue $1 \\le r_j \\le n - 1$ of the product $zz_j$ when divided by $n$. We may state that $\\{r_1, \\dots, r_N\\} = \\{z_1, \\dots, z_N\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> (2) We are saying that the remainder of $\\frac{zz_j}{n}$ corresponds to the same integer $r_j$ for all $j = 1, \\dots, N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Let us assume that $r_i = r_j, 1 \\le i,j \\le N \\implies zz_i \\equiv zz_j \\mod n \\implies i \\equiv j \\mod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (3) Here we state that if there are some terms, say $r_i$ and $r_j : r_i = r_j$, it means that $i = j$. This means we have a one to one mapping. We may $zz_i \\equiv zz_j \\mod n \\iff z_i \\equiv z_j \\mod n$ as there exists $z^{-1}$ because $z$ is coprime to $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Since $\\{zz_1, zz_2, \\dots, zz_N\\} \\equiv \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_N\\} = \\{z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_N\\} \\mod n$, we get $$z^N \\prod_{j = 1}^{N}z_j = \\prod_{j = 1}^{N}zz_j \\equiv \\prod_{j = 1}^{N}z_j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> (4) We are saying that the product of all $z_j$ modulo $n$ is equal to the product of all $z_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Therefore, $z^N \\equiv 1 \\mod n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corollary 16\n",
    "\n",
    "$p$ is prime. Then $z^p \\equiv z \\mod p, z \\in \\Z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 17\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $p$ is prime and $r > 0$, then $\\phi(p^r)$ = p^{r - 1}(p-1).\n",
    "1. If $\\gcd(k, \\ell) = 1 \\iff \\phi(k\\ell) = \\phi(k)\\phi(\\ell)$.\n",
    "1. If $n = \\prod_{j = 1}^{s}p_j^{r_j}$, where $p_1, \\dots, p_s$ are distinct primes and $r_1, \\dots, r_s > 0$, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(n) = \\prod_{j = 1}^{s}p_j^{r_j - 1}(p_j - 1) = n\\prod_{j = 1}^{s}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_j}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 18\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $d$ be the divisor of $n$. Then the number of integers $z$ with $1 \\le z \\le n$ and $\\gcd(z, n) = d$ is $\\phi\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n \\in \\N$. If there exists a positive integer $d$ such that $z^d \\equiv 1 \\mod n$, then the order of $z \\mod n$ is the smallest of all integers $d$. the order of $z$ may be defined as the smallest integer $d$ such that $[z]_n^d = [1]_n$ in the set $\\Z / n\\Z$ of congruence classes modulo $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemma 19\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $z$ has order $d$. If $z^e \\equiv 1 \\mod n$, then $d | e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 20\n",
    "\n",
    "For integers $z \\exists d \\in \\N : z^d \\equiv 1 \\mod n \\iff \\gcd(z, n) = 1$. If so, the order of $z$ divides $\\phi(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "let $p$ be a prime number. An integer $z$ is said to be a primitive root $\\mod p$ if $z$ has order $p - 1 (\\mod p)$. Note that since $\\phi(p) = p - 1$, a primitive root has the maximum possible order. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, some integer $z$ is a primitive root $\\mod p$ if $z$ has order $1$ though $p - 1$, $\\{z^1 \\mod p, z^2 \\mod p, z^3 \\mod p, \\dots, z^{\\phi(p)} \\mod p\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of congruence classes, $z$ is a primitive root $\\mod p$ if its $\\mod p$ congruence class $[z]_p$ has order $p - 1$, in the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$, i.e., the smallest positive integer $N$ such that $[z]^N = [z^N] = [1]$ holds in $N = p - 1$. $[z]$ generates the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$ i.e., $\\{[z]^1, [z]^2, [z]^3, \\dots, [z]^{p - 1}\\} = \\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times = \\{[1], \\dots, [p - 1]\\}$, and that $z' \\equiv z \\mod p$, then $[z] = [z']$; it is only necessary to understand the orders of $1, \\dots, p - 1 \\mod p$ to stop all the primitive roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "_____\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example__: What are the primitive roots of $\\mod p = 7$ ? \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z \\in \\{3, 5\\} \\impliedby z = 3 : z^1 \\mod 7 = 3, z^2 \\mod 7= 2, z^3 \\mod 7 = 6, = 4, = 5, = 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = 5 : z^1 \\mod 7 = 5, z^2 \\mod 7 = 4, z^3 \\mod 7 = 6, = 2, = 3, = 1.$$\n",
    "_____\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemma 21\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p$ be a prime and $d$ be a divisor of $p - 1$. Then the number of elements in $\\{1, \\dots, p - 1\\}$ of order $d \\mod p$ is either $o$ or $\\phi(d)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 22\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p$ be a prime. For every number $d$ dividing $p - 1$, let $S_{p - 1}^d$ denote the set of all elements in $\\{1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ of order $d \\mod p$. Then $$|S_{p - 1}^d| = \\phi(d).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular there are $\\phi(p - 1)$ primitive roots $\\mod p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 23\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $z$ be a primitive root $\\mod p$. Then the order $\\mod p$ of $z^n$ is equal to $\\frac{p-1}{\\gcd(n, p-1)}$. \n",

    "## Quadratic Residue and Non-Residues and Guass's Reciprocity Law\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is is concerned with equations given modulo $p$ such that $p$ is prime, and we have $x^2 \\equiv a \\mod p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Quadratic Residue and Non-Residue\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $a \\in \\Z : p \\nmid a$. It is a quadratic residue if $\\exists z : z^2 \\equiv a \\mod p$, and $a$ is a quadratic non residue if $\\nexists z : z^2 \\equiv a \\mod p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense to define an integer $a$, divisible $p$, to be a quadratic residue $\\mod p$. As $a \\equiv 0 \\mod p$ by assumption, for any $z$ divisible by $p$ (e.g., $z = 0$), we have $z^2 \\equiv 0 \\equiv a \\mod p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another __remark__ is that if $a \\equiv b \\mod p$, then $a$ is a quadratic residue $\\iff$ $b$ is a quadratic residue $\\mod p$. Therefore it suffices to consider $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, p - 1\\}$. To work out which integers $1 \\le a \\le p - 1$ are quadratic residue $\\mod p$ or not, one way of doing it is to list all square integers $\\mod p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_____\n",
    "__Example__: For $p = 7$, what are the quadratic residues?\n",
    "\n",
    "One simply squares all integers $1 \\le a \\le p - 1$, and takes the modulo $p$ of the result. This gives all the quadratic residues $\\mod p$. For $7$, the quadratic residue is $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\n",
    "_____\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $a^2 \\equiv (p - a)^2 \\equiv (-a)^2 \\mod p$. This means that we only have to check up to $a \\le \\frac{p}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p$ be an odd prime. By __Theorem 22__: 'Let $p$ be a prime. For every number $d$ dividing $p - 1$, let $S_{p - 1}^d$ denote the set of all elements in $\\{1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ of order $d \\mod p$. Then $|S_{p - 1}^d| = \\phi(d).$' $\\exists z \\mod p$, such that $z$ is a primitive root. There are, as we can recall, $\\phi(p - 1)$ primitive roots $\\mod p$. Now, consider the set $\\{1, z, z^2, \\dots, z^{p - 2}\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, no elements are congruent to $0 \\mod p$. This is because we working with modulo $p$, the set of numbers in the modulo is $\\{1, \\dots, p - 1\\}$. This set does not contain $0$, as there is no multiplicative inverse for $0$. In more formal terms, $0$ is not a unit in $\\Z_p^\\times$. i.e., $a \\times 0 \\equiv 1 \\mod p$, there exists no such $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of contradiction, say $z^j \\equiv 0 \\mod p, 1 \\le j \\le p - 2 \\implies z \\equiv 0 \\mod p$. Secondly, $\\{1, z, z^2, \\dots, z^{p -2}\\}$ is in bijection with $\\{1, \\dots, p - 1\\} \\iff \\{[1], [z], \\dots, [z^{p-2}]\\} = \\{[1]_p, \\dots, [p-1]\\}$. This bijection is implied by the fact that all $z^j$'s are distinct modulo $p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a \\equiv z^j, 0 \\le j \\le p - 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 24\n",
    "\n",
    "$a$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ $\\iff$ $a$ is an even power of $z$; and is a quadratic non residue modulo $p$ $\\iff$ $a$ is an odd power of $z$."
